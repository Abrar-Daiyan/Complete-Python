# Python Mastery Roadmap

## Overview
I am on a mission to master Python in 3 months by learning from top educational platforms and completing a series of projects. This journey will cover everything from the basics to advanced applications through hands-on experience.

## Learning Resources
I will be learning Python from the following platforms:
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
- Other high-quality resources as needed

## Project-Based Learning
To solidify my understanding, I will complete the following projects:
- **150 Mini Projects** â€“ Small exercises to reinforce concepts
- **100 Full Projects** â€“ Larger projects that apply Python to real-world scenarios

## Project Categories
### Mini Projects (150)
These will focus on fundamental Python concepts such as:
- Basic syntax and logic
- Data structures and algorithms
- File handling
- API requests
- Automation scripts
- Small GUI applications
- Web scraping

### Full Projects (100)
These will be more complex and will involve:
- Web development (Django, Flask, FastAPI)
- Data Science and Machine Learning
- Game Development
- Automation & Scripting
- AI-powered applications
- Cybersecurity tools
- Blockchain development
- Robotics with Arduino & Raspberry Pi

## Progress Tracking
I will track my progress using:
- A GitHub repository for storing my projects
- A journal/log to document my learning
- Regular updates on social media to share insights

## Goals
- Achieve Python fluency by building real-world applications
- Gain expertise in Pythonâ€™s core libraries and frameworks
- Strengthen problem-solving skills through practical coding
- Use Python in robotics, AI, automation, and web development
